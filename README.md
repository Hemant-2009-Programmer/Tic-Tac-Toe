# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe is a simple game played on a 3x3 grid. Two players, X and O, take turns marking cells. The goal is to align three of your marks in a row, column, or diagonal. The game ends when a player succeeds or all cells are filled, resulting in a draw. Easy and strategic for all ages.
